# Hotel-Review-Project
A hotel recommendation system aims to predict which hotel a user is most likely to choose from among all hotels.
We will use the 515k Hotel Reviews Data in Europe dataset from Kaggle. 
This data was scraped from booking.com and has many useful features for extensive exploratory data analysis(EDA) and modelling.
As we are going to build a recommendation system according to the user ratings so here I will be using Natural Language Processing.
